# GC v1 Extensions

*Note: This design is still in flux!*

See [overview](Overview.md) for background.

The functionality provided with this first version of GC support for Wasm is intentionally limited in the spirit of a "a minimal viable product" (MVP).
As a rough guideline, it includes only essential functionality and avoids features that may provide better performance in some cases, but whose lack can be worked around in a reasonable manner.

In particular, it is expected that compiling to this minimal functionality will require a substantial number of runtime casts that may be eliminated by future extensions.
A range of such extensions are discussed in the [Post-MVP](Post-MVP.md) document.
Most of them are expected to be added before GC support can be considered reasonably "complete".


## Language

Based on the following proposals:

* [reference types](https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types), which introduces reference types

* [typed function references](https://github.com/WebAssembly/function-references), which introduces typed references `(ref null? $t)` etc.

Both proposals are prerequisites.


### Types

#### Heap Types

[Heap types](https://github.com/WebAssembly/function-references/blob/master/proposals/function-references/Overview.md#types) classify reference types and are extended:

* `eq` is a new heap type
  - `heaptype ::= ... | eq`
  - the common supertype of all referenceable types on which comparison (`ref.eq`) is allowed

* `data` is a new heap type
  - `heaptype ::= ... | data`
  - the common supertype of all compound data types, like struct and array types and possibly host-defined types, for which casts are allowed

* `array` is a new heap type
  - `heaptype ::= ... | array`
  - the common supertype of all array types

* `i31` is a new heap type
  - `heaptype ::= ... | i31`
  - the type of unboxed scalars

* `rtt <typeidx>` is a new heap type that is a runtime representation of the static type `<typeidx>`
  - `heaptype ::= ... | rtt <typeidx>`
  - `rtt t ok` iff `t ok`

* `extern` is renamed back to `any`
  - the common supertype of all referenceable types
  - the name `extern` is kept as an alias in the text format for backwards compatibility

* Note: heap types `func` and `extern` already exist via [reference types proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types), and `(ref null? $t)` via [typed references](https://github.com/WebAssembly/function-references)

We distinguish these *abstract* heap types from *concrete* heap types `(type $t)`.
Each abstract heap type is a supertype of a class of concrete heap types.
Moreover, they form a small [subtype hierarchy](#subtyping).


#### Reference Types

New abbreviations are introduced for reference types in binary and text format, corresponding to `funcref` and `externref`:

* `eqref` is a new reference type
  - `eqref == (ref null eq)`

* `dataref` is a new reference type
  - `dataref == (ref data)`

* `arrayref` is a new reference type
  - `arrayref == (ref array)`

* `i31ref` is a new reference type
  - `i31ref == (ref i31)`

* `rtt <typeidx>` is a new reference type
  - `(rtt $t) == (ref (rtt $t))`

* `externref` is renamed to `anyref`
  - `anyref == (ref null any)`
  - the name `externref` is kept as an alias in the text format for backwards compatibility


#### Type Definitions

* `deftype` is the syntax for an entry in the type section, generalising the existing syntax
  - `deftype ::= rec <subtype>*`
  - `module ::= {..., types vec(<deftype>)}`
  - a `rec` definition defines a group of mutually recursive types that can refer to each other; it thereby defines several type indices at a time
  - a single type definition, as in Wasm before this proposal, is reinterpreted as a short-hand for a recursive group containing just one type

* `subtype` is a new category of type defining a single type, as a subtype of possible other types
  - `subtype ::= sub <typeidx>* <strtype>`
  - the preexisting syntax with no `sub` clause is redefined to be a shorthand for a `sub` clause with empty `typeidx` list: `<strtype> == sub () <strtype>`
  - Note: This allows multiple supertypes. For the MVP, it is restricted to at most one supertype.

* `strtype` is a new category of types covering the different forms of concrete structural reference types
  - `strtype ::= <functype> | <structtype> | <arraytype>`

* `structtype` describes a structure with statically indexed fields
  - `structtype ::= struct <fieldtype>*`

* `arraytype` describes an array with dynamically indexed fields
  - `arraytype ::= array <fieldtype>`
  - Note: in the MVP, all arrays must be defined as mutable

* `fieldtype` describes a struct or array field and whether it is mutable
  - `fieldtype ::= <mutability> <storagetype>`
  - `storagetype ::= <valtype> | <packedtype>`
  - `packedtype ::= i8 | i16`

TODO: Need to be able to use `i31` as a type definition.


#### Type Contexts

Validity of a module is checked under a context storing the definitions for each type. In the case of recursive types, this definition is given by a respective projection from the full type:
```
ctxtype ::= <deftype>.<i>
```

#### Auxiliary Definitions

* Unpacking a storage type yields `i32` for packed types, otherwise the type itself
  - `unpacked(t) = t`
  - `unpacked(pt) = i32`

* Unrolling a possibly recursive context type projects the respective item
  - `unroll($t)                 = unroll(<ctxtype>)`  iff `$t = <ctxtype>`
  - `unroll((rec <subtype>*).i) = (<subtype>*)[i]`

* Expanding a type definition unrolls it and returns its plain definition
  - `expand($t)                 = expand(<ctxtype>)`  iff `$t = <ctxtype>`
  - `expand(<ctxtype>) = <strtype>`
    - where `unroll(<ctxttype>) = sub x* <strtype>`


#### Type Validity

Some of the rules define a type as `ok` for a certain index, written `ok(x)`. This controls uses of type indices as supertypes inside a recursive group: the subtype hierarchy must not be cyclic, and hence any type index used for a supertype is required to be smaller than the index `x` of the current type.

* a sequence of type definitions is valid if each item is valid within the context containing the prior items
  - `<deftype0> <deftype>* ok`
    - iff `<deftype0> ok` and extends the context accordingly
    - and `<deftype>* ok` under the extended context

* a group of recursive type definitions is valid if its types are valid under the context containing all of them
  - `rec <subtype>* ok` and extends the context with `<ctxtype>*`
    - iff `<subtype>* ok($t)` under the extended context(!)
    - where `$t` is the next unused (i.e., current) type index
    - and `N = |<subtype>*|-1`
    - and `<ctxtype>*  = (rec <subtype>*).0, ..., (rec <subtype>*).N`

* a sequence of subtype's is valid of each of them is valid for their respective index
  - `<subtype0> <subtype>* ok($t)`
    - iff `<subtype0> ok($t)`
    - and `<subtype>* ok($t+1)`

* an individual subtype is valid if its definition is valid, matches every supertype, and no supertype has an index higher than its own
  - `sub $t* <strtype> ok($t')`
    - iff `<strtype> ok`
    - and `(<strtype> <: expand($t))*`
    - and `($t < $t')*`
  - Note: the upper bound on the supertype indices ensures that subtyping hierarchies are never circular, because definitions need to be ordered.

* as [before](https://github.com/WebAssembly/function-references/proposals/function-references/Overview.md#types), a strtype is valid if all the occurring value types are valid
  - specifically, a concrete reference type `(ref $t)` is valid when `$t` is defined in the context

Example: Consider two mutually recursive types:
```
(rec
  (type $t1 (struct (field i32 (ref $t2))))
  (type $t2 (struct (field i64 (ref $t1))))
)
```
In the context, these will be recorded as:
```
$t1 = rect1t2.0
$t2 = rect1t2.1

where

rect1t2 = (rec
  (struct (field i32 (ref $t2)))
  (struct (field i64 (ref $t1)))
)
```
That is, the types are defined as projections from their respective recursion group, using their relative inner indices `0` and `1`.


#### Equivalence

Type equivalence, written `t == t'` here, is essentially defined inductively. All rules are simply the canonical congruences, with the exception of the rule for recursive types.

For the purpose of defining recursive type equivalence, type indices are extended with a special form that distinguishes regular from recursive type uses.

* `rec.<i>` is a new form of type index
  - `typeidx ::= ... | rec.<i>`

This form is only used during equivalence checking, to identify and represent "back edges" inside a recursive type. It is merely a technical device for formulating the rules and cannot appear in source code. It is introduced by the following auxiliary meta-function:

* Rolling a context type produces an _iso-recursive_ representation of its underlying recursion group
  - `tie($t)                    = tie_$t(<ctxtype>)`  iff `$t = <ctxtype>`
  - `tie_$t((rec <subtype>*).i) = (rec <subtype>*).i[$t':=rec.0, ..., $t'+N:=rec.N]` iff `$t' = $t-i` and `N = |<subtype>*|-1`
  - Note: This definition assumes that all projections of the recursive type are bound to consecutive type indices, so that `$t-i` is the first of them.
  - Note: If a type is not recursive, `tie` is just the identity.

With that:

* two regular type indices are equivalent if they define equivalent tied context types:
  - `$t == $t'`
    - iff `tie($t) == tie($t')`

* two recursive type indices are equivalent if they project the same index
  - `rec.i == rec.i'`
    - iff `i = i'`

* two recursive types are equivalent if they are equivalent pointwise
  - `(rec <subtype>*) == (rec <subtype'>*)`
    - iff `(<subtype> == <subtype'>)*`
  - Note: This rule is only used on types that have been tied, which prevents looping.

* notably, two subtypes are equivalent if their structure is equivalent and they have equivalent supertypes
  - `(sub $t* <strtype>) == (sub $t'* <strtype'>)`
    - iff `<strtype> == <strtype'>`
    - and `($t == $t')*`

Example: As explained above, the mutually recursive types
```
(rec
  (type $t1 (struct (field i32 (ref $t2))))
  (type $t2 (struct (field i64 (ref $t1))))
)
```
would be recorded in the context as
```
$t1 = (rec (struct (field i32 (ref $t2))) (struct (field i64 (ref $t1)))).0
$t2 = (rec (struct (field i32 (ref $t2))) (struct (field i64 (ref $t1)))).1
```
Consequently, if there was an equivalent pair of types,
```
(rec
  (type $u1 (struct (field i32 (ref $u2))))
  (type $u2 (struct (field i64 (ref $u1))))
)
```
recorded in the context as
```
$u1 = (rec (struct (field i32 (ref $u2))) (struct (field i64 (ref $u1)))).0
$u2 = (rec (struct (field i32 (ref $u2))) (struct (field i64 (ref $u1)))).1
```
then to check the equivalence `$t1 == $u1`, both types are tied into iso-recursive types first:
```
tie($t1) = (rec (struct (field i32 (ref rec.1))) (struct (field i64 (ref rec.0)))).0
tie($u1) = (rec (struct (field i32 (ref rec.1))) (struct (field i64 (ref rec.0)))).0
```
In this case, it is immediately apparent that these are equivalent types.

Note: In type-theoretic terms, these are higher-kinded iso-recursive types:
```
tie($t1) ~ (mu a. <(struct (field i32 (ref a.1))), (struct i64 (field (ref a.0)))>).0
tie($t2) ~ (mu a. <(struct (field i32 (ref a.1))), (struct i64 (field (ref a.0)))>).1
```
where `<...>` denotes a type tuple. However, in our case, a single syntactic type variable `rec` is enough for all types, because recursive types cannot nest by construction.

Note 2: This semantics implies that type equivalence checks can be implemented in constant-time by representing all types as trees in tied form and canonicalising them bottom-up in linear time upfront.

Note 3: It's worth noting that the only observable difference to the rules for a nominal type system is the equivalence rule on (non-recursive) type indices: instead of comparing the definitions of their recursive groups, a nominal system would require `$t = $t'` syntactically (at least as long as we ignore things like checking imports, where type indices become meaningless).
Consequently, using a single big recursion group in this system makes it behave like a nominal system.


#### Subtyping

##### Type Indices

In the [existing rules](https://github.com/WebAssembly/function-references/proposals/function-references/Overview.md#subtyping), subtyping on type indices required equivalence. Now it can take declared supertypes into account.

* Type indices are subtypes if they either define [equivalent](#type-equivalence) types or a suitable (direct or indirect) subtype relation has been declared
  - `$t <: $t'`
    - if `$t = <ctxtype>` and `$t' = <ctxtype'>` and `<ctxtype> == <ctxtype'>`
    - or `unroll($t) = sub $1* $t'' $t2* strtype` and `$t'' <: $t`
  - Note: This rule climbs the supertype hierarchy until an equivalent type has been found. Effectively, this means that subtyping is "nominal" modulo type canonicalisation.


##### Heap Types

In addition to the [existing rules](https://github.com/WebAssembly/function-references/proposals/function-references/Overview.md#subtyping) for heap types, the following are added:

* every type is a subtype of `any`
  - `t <: any`

* `dataref` is a subtype of `eqref`
  - `data <: eq`
  - TODO: provide a way to make data types non-eq, especially immutable ones?

* `arrayref` is a subtype of `dataref`
  - `array <: data`

* `i31ref` is a subtype of `eqref`
  - `i31 <: eq`

* Any concrete type is a subtype of either `data` or `func`
  - `$t <: data`
     - if `$t = <structtype>` or `$t = <arraytype>`
  - `$t <: func`
     - if `$t = <functype>`

* Any concrete array type is a subtype of `array`
  - `(type $t) <: array`
     - if `$t = <arraytype>`

* `rtt $t` is a subtype of `eq`
  - `rtt $t <: eq`
  - Note: `rtt $t1` is *not* a subtype of `rtt $t2`, unless `$t1` and `$t2` are equivalent; covariant subtyping would be unsound, since RTTs are used in both co- and contravariant roles (e.g., both when constructing and consuming a reference)

Note: This creates a hierarchy of *abstract* Wasm heap types that looks as follows.
```
      any
     /   \
   eq    func
  /  \
i31  data
       \
       array
```
All *concrete* heap types (of the form `(type $t)`) are situated below either `data` or `func`.
RTTs are below `eq`.

In addition, a host environment may introduce additional inhabitants of type `any`
that are are in neither of the above three leaf type categories.
The interpretation of such values is defined by the host environment.

Note: In the future, this hierarchy could be refined, e.g., to distinguish compound data types that are not subtypes of `eq`.


##### Structural Types

The subtyping rules for structural types are only invoked during validation of a `sub` [type definition](#type-definitions).

* Structure types support width and depth subtyping
  - `struct <fieldtype1>* <fieldtype1'>* <: struct <fieldtype2>*`
    - iff `(<fieldtype1> <: <fieldtype2>)*`

* Array types support depth subtyping
  - `array <fieldtype1> <: array <fieldtype2>`
    - iff `<fieldtype1> <: <fieldtype2>`

* Field types are covariant if they are immutable, invariant otherwise
  - `const <valtype1> <: const <valtype2>`
    - iff `<valtype1> <: <valtype2>`
  - `var <valtype> <: var <valtype>`
  - Note: mutable fields are *not* subtypes of immutable ones, so `const` really means constant, not read-only


##### Type Definitions

Subtyping is not defined on type definitions.


### Runtime

#### Runtime Types

* Runtime types (RTTs) are explicit values representing concrete types at runtime; a value of type `rtt <typeidx>` is a dynamic representative of the static type `<typeidx>`.

* All RTTs are explicitly created and all operations involving dynamic type information (like casts) operate on explicit RTT operands. This allows maximum flexibility and custom choices wrt which RTTs to represent a source type.

* An RTT value r1 is *equal* to another RTT value r2 iff they both represent the same static type.

* An RTT value r1 is a *subtype* of another RTT value r2 iff they represent static types that are in a respective subtype relation.

Note: RTT values correspond to type descriptors or "shape" objects as they exist in various engines.
RTT equality can be implemented as a single pointer test by memoising RTT values.
More interestingly, runtime casts along the hierarchy encoded in these values can be implemented in an engine efficiently
by using well-known techniques such as including a vector of its (direct and indirect) super-RTTs in each RTT value (with itself as the last entry).
A subtype check between two RTT values can be implemented as follows using such a representation.
Assume RTT value v1 has static type `(rtt $t1)` and v2 has type `(rtt $t2)`.
Let `n1` and `n2` be the lengths of the respective supertype vectors.
To check whether v1 denotes a subtype RTT of v2, first verify that `n1 >= n2` --
if both `n1` and `n2` are known statically, this can be performed at compile time;
if either is not statically known (`$t1` and `n1` are typically unknown during a cast),
it has to be read from the respective RTT value dynamically, and `n1 >= n2` becomes a dynamic check.
Then compare v2 to the n2-th entry in v1's supertype vector.
If they are equal, v1 is a subtype RTT.
In the case of actual casts, the static type of RTT v1 (obtained from the value to cast) is not known at compile time, so `n1` is dynamic as well.
(Note that `$t1` and `$t2` are not relevant for the dynamic semantics,
but merely for validation.)

Note: This assumes that there is at most one supertype. For hierarchies with multiple supertypes, more complex tests would be necessary.

Example: Consider three types and corresponding RTTs:
```
(type $A (struct))
(type $B (sub $A (struct (field i32))))
(type $C (sub $B (struct (field i32 i64))))

(global $rttA (rtt 0 $A) (rtt.canon $A))
(global $rttB (rtt 1 $B) (rtt.canon $B))
(global $rttC (rtt 2 $C) (rtt.canon $C))
```
Here, `$rttA` would carry supertype vector `[$rttA]`, `$rttB` has `[$rttA, $rttB]`, and `$rttC` has `[$rttA, $rttB, $rttC]`.

Now consider a function that casts a `$B` to a `$C`:
```
(func $castBtoC (param $x (ref $B)) (result (ref $C))
  (ref.cast (local.get $x) (global.get $rttC))
)
```
This can compile to machine code that (1) reads the RTT from `$x`, (2) checks that the length of its supertype table is >= 3, and (3) pointer-compares table[2] against `$rttC`.


#### Values

* Creating a structure or array requires supplying a suitable RTT value to represent its runtime type.

* Reference values of data or function type have an associated runtime type:
  - for structures or arrays, it is the RTT value provided upon creation,
  - for functions, it is the RTT value for the function's type (which may be recursive).

* Note: as a future extension, we could allow a value's RTT to be a supertype of the value's actual type. For example, a structure or array with RTT `any` would become fully opaque to runtime type checks, and an implementation may choose to optimize away its RTT.


### Instructions

* `ref.eq` compares two references whose types support equality
  - `ref.eq : [eqref eqref] -> [i32]`

    - and `t'` is numeric or packed numeric
    - and `$d` is a defined data segment
  - the 1st operand is the `offset` into the segment
  - the 2nd operand is the `size` of the array
  - traps if `offset + |t'|*size > len($d)`
  - this is a *constant instruction*

* `array.new_elem <typeidx> <elemidx>` allocates an array and initialises it from an element segment
  - `array.new_elem $t $e : [i32 i32 (rtt $t)] -> [(ref $t)]`
    - iff `expand($t) = array (mut t')`
    - and `$e : rt`
    - and `rt <: t'`
  - the 1st operand is the `offset` into the segment
  - the 2nd operand is the `size` of the array
  - traps if `offset + size > len($e)`
  - note: for now, this is _not_ a constant instruction, in order to side-step issues of recursion between binary sections; this restriction will be lifted later

  - traps on `null`


#### Unboxed Scalars

Tentatively, support a type of guaranteed unboxed scalars.

* `i31.new` creates an `i31ref` from a 32 bit value, truncating high bit
  - `i31.new : [i32] -> [i31ref]`
  - this is a *constant instruction*

* `i31.get_<sx>` extracts the value, zero- or sign-extending
  - `i31.get_<sx> : [i31ref] -> [i32]`


#### Classification

* `ref.is_func` checks whether a reference is a function
  - `ref.is_func : [anyref] -> [i32]`

* `ref.is_data` checks whether a reference is compound data
  - `ref.is_data : [anyref] -> [i32]`

* `ref.is_array` checks whether a reference is an array
  - `ref.is_array : [anyref] -> [i32]`

* `ref.is_i31` checks whether a reference is an i31
  - `ref.is_i31 : [anyref] -> [i32]`

* `br_on_func <labelidx>` branches if a reference is a function
  - `br_on_func $l : [t0* t] -> [t0* t]`
    - iff `$l : [t0* t']`
    - and `t <: anyref`
    - and `(ref func) <: t'`
  - passes operand along with branch as a function, plus possible extra args

* `br_on_non_func <labelidx>` branches if a reference is not a function
  - `br_on_non_func $l : [t0* t] -> [t0* (ref func)]`
    - iff `$l : [t0* t']`
    - and `t <: anyref`
    - and `t <: t'`
  - passes operand along with branch, plus possible extra args

* `br_on_data <labelidx>` branches if a reference is compound data
  - `br_on_data $l : [t0* t] -> [t0* t]`

    - and `t <: anyref`
    - and `(ref data) <: t'`
  - passes operand along with branch as data, plus possible extra args

* `br_on_non_data <labelidx>` branches if a reference is not compound data
  - `br_on_non_data $l : [t0* t] -> [t0* (ref data)]`

    - and `t <: anyref`
    - and `t <: t'`
  - passes operand along with branch, plus possible extra args

* `br_on_array <labelidx>` branches if a reference is an array
  - `br_on_array $l : [t0* t] -> [t0* t]`
    - iff `$l : [t0* t']`
    - and `t <: anyref`
    - and `(ref array) <: t'`

* `br_on_non_array <labelidx>` branches if a reference is not an array
  - `br_on_non_array $l : [t0* t] -> [t0* (ref array)]`

    - and `t <: t'`
  - passes operand along with branch, plus possible extra args

* `br_on_i31 <labelidx>` branches if a reference is an integer
  - `br_on_i31 $l : [t0* t] -> [t0* t]`
    - iff `$l : [t0* t']`
    - and `t <: anyref`
    - and `(ref i31) <: t'`
  - passes operand along with branch as a scalar, plus possible extra args

* `br_on_non_i31 <labelidx>` branches if a reference is not an integer

    - and `t <: anyref`
    - and `t <: t'`
  - passes operand along with branch, plus possible extra args

* `ref.as_func` converts to a function reference
  - `ref.as_func : [anyref] -> [(ref func)]`
  - traps if reference is not a function
  - equivalent to `(block $l (param anyref) (result (ref func)) (br_on_func $l) (unreachable))`

* `ref.as_data` converts to a data reference
  - `ref.as_data : [anyref] -> [(ref data)]`
  - traps if reference is not compound data
  - equivalent to `(block $l (param anyref) (result (ref data)) (br_on_data $l) (unreachable))`

* `ref.as_array` converts to an array reference
  - `ref.as_array : [anyref] -> [(ref array)]`
  - traps if reference is not an array
  - equivalent to `(block $l (param anyref) (result (ref array)) (br_on_array $l) (unreachable))`

* `ref.as_i31` converts to an integer reference
  - `ref.as_i31 : [anyref] -> [(ref i31)]`
  - traps if reference is not an integer
  - equivalent to `(block $l (param anyref) (result (ref i31)) (br_on_i31 $l) (unreachable))`

Note: The [reference types](https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types) and [typed function references](https://github.com/WebAssembly/function-references)already introduce similar `ref.is_null`, `br_on_null`, and `br_on_non_null` instructions.

Note: The `br_on_*` instructions allow an operand of unrelated reference type, even though this cannot possibly succeed. That's because subtyping allows to forget that information, so by the subtype substitutibility property, it would be accepted in any case. The given typing rules merely allow this type to also propagate to the result, which avoids the need to compute a least upper bound between the operand type and the target type in the typing algorithm.


#### Runtime Types

* `rtt.canon <typeidx>` returns the RTT of the specified type
  - `rtt.canon $t : [] -> [(rtt $t)]`
  - multiple invocations of this instruction yield the same observable RTTs
  - this is a *constant instruction*

TODO: Add the ability to generate new (non-canonical) RTT values to implement casting in nominal type hierarchies?


#### Casts

RTT-based casts can only be performed with respect to concrete types, and require a data or function reference as input, which are known to carry an RTT.

* `ref.test` tests whether a reference value's [runtime type](#values) is a [runtime subtype](#runtime) of a given RTT
  - `ref.test : [t' (rtt $t)] -> [i32]`
    - iff `t' <: (ref null data)` or `t' <: (ref null func)`
  - returns 1 if the first operand is not null and its runtime type is a sub-RTT of the RTT operand, 0 otherwise

* `ref.cast` casts a reference value down to a type given by a RTT representation
  - `ref.cast : [(ref null1? ht) (rtt $t)] -> [(ref null2? $t)]`
    - iff `ht <: data` or `ht <: func`
    - and `null1? = null2?`
  - returns null if the first operand is null
  - traps if the first operand is not null and its runtime type is not a sub-RTT of the RTT operand

* `br_on_cast <labelidx>` branches if a value can be cast down to a given reference type
  - `br_on_cast $l : [t0* t (rtt $t')] -> [t0* t]`
    - iff `$l : [t0* t']`
    - and `t <: (ref null data)` or `t <: (ref null func)`
    - and `(ref $t') <: t'`
  - branches iff the first operand is not null and its runtime type is a sub-RTT of the RTT operand
  - passes cast operand along with branch, plus possible extra args

* `br_on_cast_fail <labelidx>` branches if a value can not be cast down to a given reference type
  - `br_on_cast_fail $l : [t0* t (rtt $t')] -> [t0* (ref $t')]`
    - iff `$l : [t0* t']`
    - and `t <: (ref null data)` or `t <: (ref null func)`
    - and `t <: t'`
  - branches iff the first operand is null or its runtime type is not a sub-RTT of the RTT operand
  - passes operand along with branch, plus possible extra args

Note: These instructions allow an operand of unrelated reference type, even though this cannot possibly succeed. The reasoning is the same as for classification instructions.


#### Constant Expressions

In order to allow RTTs to be initialised as globals, the following extensions are made to the definition of *constant expressions*:

* `rtt.canon` is a constant instruction
* `i31.new` is a constant instruction
* `struct.new` and `struct.new_default` are constant instructions
* `array.new`, `array.new_default`, `array.new_fixed`, and `array.new_data` are constant instructions
  - Note: `array.new_elem` is not for the time being, see above
* `global.get` is a constant instruction and can access preceding (immutable) global definitions, not just imports as in the MVP

## Questions

* Make rtt operands nullable?

* Enable `i31` as a type definition.

* Should reference types be generalised to *unions*, e.g., of the form `(ref null? i31? data? func? extern? $t?)`? Perhaps even allowing multiple concrete types?

* Provide functionality to generate fresh, non-canonical RTTs?

* Provide a way to make data types non-eq, especially immutable ones?
